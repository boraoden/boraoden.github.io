oh, i wasn't posting in english for a while. just wanted to write something more on this beautiful song of placebo and myself. [this](https://boraoden.net/i-know-en) was not enough apparently.

i know better now, why brian molko wrote the lyrics "the past will catch you up as you run faster". it's impossible to escape from past; not only your own past of course, the past of your loved ones too.

but i also remember myself watching _scott pilgrim vs the world_ in february, embracing the motivation to accept every past, everything, healing myself on my own past with bitter experiences. and movie was good.
thought i overcame my that instinct after movie, even wrote a [nice essay here](https://boraoden.net/scott-pilgrim-ve-iliskiler-ustune-fikirler-tr) which i should read more often maybe. i learned that to grow something valuable, to grow something genuine, both sides has to face the past of each other. this facing can be smooth or can be really hard, but facing was almost inevitable.

but bora, what did go wrong for you? why do you have to remind yourself every time that those past will chase you all the time. why you are letting it to chase you in first place?

dear bora, can't you see it's ruining you? didn't you take your lesson you idiot?

why can't you see it caused you to lose something you valued before and can cause it again?

why are you allowing it you dumb, why are you allowing it to make you feel jealous for unimportant things again?

why are you not make yourself realize that no one is your possession and you can't rule the past?

why are you allowing it to hurt a relationship even though you have experienced it exactly?

this time you're not the victim even you stupid. you're just playing your cards to be sad, make yourself upset. she didn't even mention one thing about her past you moron.

why do you want to spoil what you have?

why are you doing this to yourself, what does it change? what are you expecting you fool?

why are you acting towards losing your lover, losing your friend, my boy?

why are you treating yourself, your relationship like this, why are you so curious to ruin your most precious possession in this life?

don't you see you're pathetic that you're sticking to past, being insecure, excessively thoughtful?

don't know you how bad is feeling like "got no friends and got no lover" from _for what's it worth_?

you know that you should not do this, bora, you should just let it go my buddy, let it go and pass...

but you are fearful that you can't do it and even though you somehow hide it, you are afraid that you can't eliminate that feeling never. 

but it's worth trying bora, worth trying.

do you want your soulmate to see at [the bitter end](https://open.spotify.com/track/3WBPiogtVDBSXK7uOpxJ6m?si=8efc9b6054394348) you dumbfuck?

oh bora, you're so coward, so frantic, dude.

you said her that i am ready to everything [because i want you](https://open.spotify.com/track/3BCwHknc8WQtp1iN2BSECe?si=271759c0735149f8). why don't you act like that then boy?
