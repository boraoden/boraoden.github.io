summer 24' was such an mind-opening period and experience for me. from meaningful dinners to never-ending conversations, from different movies and tv shows to wonderful trips. it ended promising too, at least that was what i thought.

today, i saw the trailer for the season 4 of the show _the bear_. first season was exciting and catchy for sure yet the sequel seasons were mildly failure. sometimes you just shouldn't water the plastic flowers just for the sake of their hopeful-looking but unfortunately fake core. and sometimes, some flowers just don't grow in some soils. thank you, aykut kocaman. lol.

relationships rely to this idea too i am starting to believe. sure, there is value in effort to keep things alive, make memories stay pure and untouched in their the most amazing form. it's worth it, until the effort starts to make you question your own dignity, your self esteem. i know, you want the sin without the sinner. placebo always hits the correct spot.

people can change, however not all of them. cruel, rough and maybe impulsive mistakes will be repeated by some people. you may think they can change, your eyes can get blind by the bright shining lights of beautiful emotions and hopes. even though you can lie to yourself through hard times, the past almost never lies. innocent looking, repeating betrayals and disappointments will seem different to you, at that point you will realize again that some mistakes cannot be forgiven, ever. 

you somehow, instantly will turn into a problem when you were the answer two years ago. that cycle will continue, while you will just stay used and left behind by the ruthless soul digesters.

it will hit the most when you see yourself questioning the quote "don't cry because it's over. smile because it happened." 
road was beautiful indeed, yet how you crossed the finish line will feel like an unexpected punch in the face.

and in the end,

"yes, chef!" will become "farewell, chef."
