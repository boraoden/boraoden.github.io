i saw the trailer for the season 4 of the show _the bear_. first season was exciting and catchy for sure yet the sequel seasons were mildly failure. sometimes you just shouldn't water the beautifully grown plants just for the sake of their promising-looking but fake seeds. and sometimes, some flowers just don't grow in some soils. thank you, aykut kocaman. lol.

relationships rely to this idea too i am starting to believe. sure, there is value in effort to keep things alive, make memories stay pure and untouched in their most amazing form. it's worth it, until the effort starts to make you question your own dignity, your self esteem. i know, you want the sin without the sinner. placebo always hits the correct spot.

people can change, however not all of them. cruel, rough and maybe impulsive mistakes will be repeated by some people. you may think they can change, your eyes can get blind by the bright shining lights of beautiful emotions and hopes. even though you can lie to yourself through hard times, the past usually never lies. innocent looking, repeating betrayals and disappointments will look different to you in the point where you realize the past will never lie. you somehow turn into problem when you were the answer two years ago.

and in the end,

"yes, chef!" becomes "farewell, chef."
