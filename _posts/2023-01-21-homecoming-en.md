oh boy, it has been a while since i last wrote from our shitty town _jolly old niÄŸde_. it looks like nothing has changed but me here. i remember the days after the final exam of third grade that i was waiting full of anxiety for the results of that creepy exam via watching _the last dance_ from netflix. those days were in the end of the june dude, i still got surprised everytime when i think about the pace of the time passing by. it makes seven months, yet i feel those days fresh as last week.
