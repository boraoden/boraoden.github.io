oh boy, it has been a while since i last wrote from our shitty town _jolly old niğde_. it looks like nothing has changed but me here. i remember the days after the final exam of third grade that i was waiting full of anxiety for the results of that creepy exam via watching _the last dance_ from netflix. those days were in the end of the june dude, i still got surprised everytime when i think about the pace of the time passing by. it makes seven months, yet i feel those days fresh as last week.

that june 2022 bora was quite a little boy to be honest, both physically and mentally though. yeah, i still cannot get rid of the weight i gained in stockholm. those _kanelbulles_ was worth it, i don't regret any bite of them to this day. but i continued to eat unhealthily after i came back to turkey, i totally don't approve myself. whatever, this wasn't the point in first place.

i can easily say that june 2022 bora has changed incredibly to this day. he had an amazing two months in stockholm in summer and experienced semi-working-life-lifestyle while completely living abroad for replete two months. that bora wasn't a tourist in scandinavia, he was a native junior intern and stockholm-er.

he, of course, returned to turkey and started a intense school semester. that bora has overcomed the pediatrics and internal medicine rotation somehow. he experienced the hospital life and feeling of being a intern doctor to even his smallest capillaries for four difficult months. he realized that he didn't learn anything in previous three years and he started to admire _medicine_ in general.

but the the most important thing is that he met a girl, he met his first girlfriend and broke up with her in school. he got dumped in a vicious way. the relationship didn't last much but bora has certainly learnt critical facts either about himself, women and relationships. he experienced the peak of the amazing feelings and the most deep pit of harsh feelings. 

that bora, who is writing from the starbucks of, the worst city ever, niğde feels like a mature man now. he met and talked his friend ametg. ametg has also changed a lot, he had great improvements in his life too both in a good and poor way.
