you always know that there'll be a mirror right opposite to you _before_ opening a _richard linklater_ movie. this essence of _linklater_ cinema make me think, look behind to my past and make me stop a bit in my life. his creativity and success while reflecting us to us is what makes _richard linklater_ one of my favourite directors.

having some common points with mason made me love _boyhood_ more. especially when you're with the same age and have similar personality with him, you feel like watching your own childhood, this sense was too powerful and familiar in some particular moments and scenes. weirdly i dream myself as mason in that scenes. 

as great as in his famous trilogy, in _boyhood_ we counter some events and persons like we counter in our unique lives. they are precious no matter what they are. they are little beautiful things that makes us, us. from an existential approach, at the age of 18, we are what we have chose at age of 12 on something unimportant for example.

well, searching for answers and meaning is one of the significant reasons we use literature, cinema, music, games, philosophy, history for. we cry with movies, laugh with them, gain knowledge from them. 
but when you witness life from _linklater_ perspective, you definitely see amazing dialogues with emotions and ideas in them. our common problems with our existence and longing to past are part of us, part of whole humanity since our confusing state of youthfulness.

the incomplete and weird smile and the sigh you heave after finishing these movies are the best signs of you're not same person as the beginning of the movie.
