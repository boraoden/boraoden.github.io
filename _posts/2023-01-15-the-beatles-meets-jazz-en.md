yesterday, i've gone to the concert _the beatles meets jazz_ with my mom. the tickets were sold at least before a week ago but luckily i've managed to go to concert thanks to a friend of mine. **rustam rahmedov caz trio** with the vocalist **meriç çalışan** were truly amazing! 

they started the gig with a good one; come together, and continued with _here comes the sun_, _can't buy me love_, _in my life_, _eleanor rigby_, _you never give me your money_, _while my guitar gently weeps_, _here there and everywhere_, _imagine_, _blackbird_, _the long and winding road_, _yesterday_, _hey jude_ and finally _let it be_.

pianist and vocalist lady even tried to make crowd sing _hey jude_ and _let it be_ in the end but barely managed it, it was quite a funny experience to see whole concert area to sing along with the band and fail.

yeah, that's it. i've been away from **the beatles** for a while and this concert made me remember what i enjoy while listening to **the beatles** and made me feel a deep nostalgia and longing to a few a years ago when i was listening **the fab four** intensely.

i was expecting a cover-like style performance to be honest but they literally transformed the songs into a completely different thing. they definitely made the audience feel like they are listening to a cool jazz band in new york city, hahah, what a cool experience!
