if you know just a bit about my taste of music, you would know that _placebo_ is one of my favourite bands of all time thanks to my dear friend _ametg_. my most listened song from them is probably [for what it's worth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_XJEQaYRck) but they have lots of maginificent songs in their pocket and i'm going to talk about _i know_ today.

i generally enjoy the songs with simple and meaningful lyrics rather than the ones filled with bunch of complicated parts and words with hidden meanings. the first band comes to my mind when i think about these simple-lyric-bands are _scorpions_, because they are german, they write their songs very simple yet beautiful and touching. their songs are usually simple and give their message very well and directly. 

_placebo_ isn't that kind of a band actually, they even write their songs quite poetically and i often cannot understand the meaning behind their words easily.

but, _i know_ is a lovely song that everybody could find something familiar when listened. _brian molko_ mentions it as "one of the best songs that he has written", it is overly melancholic while provoking the listener to think about the past and bitter experiences.

you feel that painful words and sense them to the every little vein through your body when he says,

> you love the song but not the singer

because what you've experienced and treated like was exactly like that. 
but after that he adds, 

> you want the sin without the sinner

and you realize that you're not treating very differently to the girls who liked you compared to how the girls you liked treated you in past. you suddenly realize that everyone is human after all and you've nothing to do about it. everybody has both desires and red flags and it is almost impossible to break them. you shouldn't attempt it anyway.

_i know_ brilliantly shows how an emotion and attitude towards someone can be universal and how we all can get sad and blue in almost certain and particular situations. i'm sure that plenty of men all over the world have seen the fire in their partner's eyes for the sins they've committed but they also knew that their partner isn't happy with them because this happens all the time and either sides are constantly suffering from this.

but the part which hits the hardest is when _brian_ says,

> the past will catch you up as you run faster

because you notice that it is possible to adapt but impossible to forget, it is possible to try but impossible escape from the past. 

the people you met've already changed you and made you who you are in some way, in some degree. the incidents and experiences you faced might have made you more tough or emotionless but it is inevitable to face them so it would be quite wise to accept and embrace.

because _i know_,

_the last in line is always called a bastard._
