Beyond Y Tu Mamá También's approach to love, relations, jealousy, adolescence, desire to create a memory in other people's life and mortality there is pure, true and intense portion of life in it. We witness a journey of three well-written human being and that's it! 
There is no "and they lived happily ever after" in this movie but it isn't also much heartbreaking. This successful condition of naturality makes us feel familiar to the whole incidents, emotions and characters.

Especially after our trio has arrived to the beach eventually, movie's visuality and colors have become more powerful. The sea has bringed a relief to each character. Also the reality of the family they have meet and the events after that made me smile. Father -Chuy- and boys'  football scene was brilliant!

To not to forget the one of the most important part of the movie, I thought I should add narrator's saying about Luisa at about the middle of the film: 
 > Luisa felt that even after people die, they're still present.
She wondered how long she would live on in the memory of others. 

Ah, this two sentences have made me pensive and may even made me write this review.

Above all, the most important part of Y Tu Mamá También for me was the end, the bittersweet but the most real part of the picture. 
After narrator's 
 > They will never meet again.
 
saying the boys' 
> - See you around?
> - Sure.

dialogue was too genuine like entire movie. The end absolutely makes us think about our lives, relations and of course their temporariness.
