Beyond _George_'s spiritual personality, we have seen the relationship between members of the _Fab Four_, we have seen what others thought about _George_, his music and his persona. 

He might be the one of the most "underrated" musicians of all time and his calm and gentle personality has shadowed his capability in music. The documentary makes us realize and it reminds us _George_'s beautiful songs both within and without _The Beatles_. As a matter of fact, his productivity and his great songs besides _John_ and _Paul_'s was one of the reasons of the breaking up of _The Beatles_, unfortunately. Because in period from 1962 to 1967~ his songwriting was not cool as band's pioneers, so that fact have made _Lennon_ and _Macca_ to fill albums with their songs. As you might know, _White Album_ showed the first traces of the band's conflicts beyond its enjoyable songs. Whole album was about like 4 solo albums under one roof.

Seeing some interesting things from his life like _Monty Python_ and Formula 1 sympathy was really nice too. 

I have closed documentary with pleasure after seeing all this footages about and interviews with _Yoko_, _Dylan_, _Pattie Boyd_, _Eric Clapton_, _George Martin_, _Tom Petty_, _Ravi Shankar_, _Maharishi_ and even _Terry Gilliam_.

Thanks to_Olivia Harrison_, _Dhani Harrison_ and _Martin Scorsese_ for this beauty. I think it would be crippled if it was shorter than this. In fact, 3.5 hours obviously wasn't enough to explain the world, music and relationships from _George_'s point of view.
