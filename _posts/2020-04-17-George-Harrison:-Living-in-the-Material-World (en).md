Beyond George's spiritual personality, we have seen the relationship between members of the Fab Four, we have seen what others thought about George, his music and his persona. 

He might be the one of the most "underrated" musicians of all time and his calm and gentle personality has shadowed his capability in music. The documentary makes us realize and it reminds us George's beautiful songs both within and without Beatles. As a matter of fact, his productivity and his great songs besides John and Paul's was one of the reasons of the breaking up of The Beatles, unfortunately. Because in period from 1962 to 1967~ his songwriting was not cool as band's pioneers, so that fact have made Lennon and Macca to fill albums with their songs. As you know, White Album showed the first traces of the band's conflicts beyond its enjoyable songs. Whole album was about like 4 solo albums under one roof.

Seeing some interesting things from his life like Monty Python and Formula 1 sympathy was really nice too. 

I have closed documentary with pleasure after seeing all this footages about and interviews with Yoko, Dylan, Pattie Boyd, Eric Clapton, George Martin, Tom Petty, Ravi Shankar, Maharishi and even Terry Gilliam.

Thanks to Olivia Harrison, Dhani Harrison and Martin Scorsese for this beauty. I think it would be crippled if it was shorter than this. In fact, 3.5 hours obviously wasn't enough to explain the world, music and relationships from George's point of view.
