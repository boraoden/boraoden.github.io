the beatles have recorded their last song together, the end, at the end of the august 1969 and they finished the song with

_and in the end
the love you take
is equal to the love you make_

i don't know how much i took it from medical school but i gave lots of love to it dear reader and now, it has ended. usually painful and stressful, sometimes joyful and inspiring, rarely an amazing journey it was. 6.5 years passed by regrets, successes, disappointments and many more.

future will show itself eventually but finally i have some time for myself. enough to study, read, eat nice, workout, run, write. one misses the human connection the most though, with every peer graduated from faculty months ago and now me graduating, i already found myself in a huge void social-wise. i am not complaining but neither romance nor friendship give me a fresh breath in the last months, it will get worse in the upcoming months i am pretty sure.

last saturday was my last shift in infectious diseases, a kind and nice resident doctor just freed me around 18.00 and just told me to go home rather than staying there until 9.00 in the morning. i had a last look to faculty from our little balcony. chatted with the nurses there for the last time, phoebe bridgers was playing at my ears that time. i felt sentimental, time passes by so incredibly quick dear reader. we should treat it way more intentionally and careful.

goodbye medical school, thanks for the ride.
