i truly believe with the melancholy and thoughtfulness; there comes the muse, inspiration and will to write, strong urge to solidify emotions with some medium. i felt this urge yesterday with some random blue moment and of course with alcohol in my blood. so on this beautiful sunday morning with a fresh breeze hitting me smoothly, amazing blue waters of aegean sea and the little greek island farmakonisi are in front of me, latter one being just 18 kilometers away. i certainly needed to write.

it's 8.30 in the morning, i played some dire straits. now, one more cup of coffee cover from tom jones is playing. while i am slowly sipping my morning coffee which i prepared in my mom's old french press, i am taking a peek towards the calm aegean sea. i remember the movie aftersun and realize i need to appreciate the british presence here in the whole aegean coast of turkey. they totally bring a brand new aura to these little towns in the west asia minor.

yesterday i was in a pub with the average age of the people there being at least 65 i guess, almost all of them were cheerful brit elders and i met brian there too. he was funny, 74 years old kind lad from newcastle. we chatted a bit, i told him about my plans, about the aspects of british culture i like. he told me about his family, his life a bit and football, hahah. he was a good lad and we became mates immediately. i felt he liked me too. i will never forget him.

pub was nice too, one of the co-owners was british woman called franke who was drinking rakÄ± mixing with sprite. band was epic. they played money for nothing, eye in the sky, billie jean, breakfast in america, one more cup of coffee and more... central didim is so dull apart from this rare instances of nice places like the yesterday's pub but right now, me looking to the peaceful and endless sea, i just feel a slight sense of relief and calmness. mersin feels completely different from here in every aspect even though it's almost the same sea. 

healing is a complicated process dear reader. it takes time for sure but it also sometimes takes dumb decisions and moves. it's not linear, it's not easy. it's painful as hell. in the world of infinite ways of communication, being ignorant of everything is so fucking hard yet one needs to overcome. one city will take place of another city, one person will take place of another person, one journey will take place of another person and more... you just need to keep the doors open.

nice to meet you my fella brian, to your health and new adventures grandpa!
