yeah yeah, i know. here is not [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) yet this screenshot was a must for an average linux user, lol.

well, this wasn't my first encounter with tux to be honest, as you can understand from title. in my high school years i was distro-hopping crazily thanks to my old brick-like lenovo g-580. we were together for 9 years until i replace it in 2022 so i can't truly complain. around 2015-2018 while it still had 4 gb of ram rather than 8, while it had a fucking  hdd rather than a ssd, believe me it wasn't the best experience of windows and i loved windows 10 in the beginning, so it was extra sad to experience just "slowness" in my beloved laptop. yeah, windows 8 but such a revolution ui-wise but man, windows 10 was good, especially after thinking of this crap called windows 11 microsoft forcing people to use. i am not even talking about windows 8.1, for real, what the fuck was that?

so yeah, my linux journey started around 8-9 years ago. of course first, i don't remember exactly but i probably tried ubuntu first and it was the ugliest thing i have ever seen, yet it became even weirder with the "unity" desktop thing canonical brought. hopefully, that era didn't last so long. i have tried mint, it was flawless yet kinda still ugly especially when you don't know how to tweak and customize it, i have used elementary os and loved it so much, it was the pretty solution that i was looking for and used for some time as my main operating system. then after some time i did some upgrades on my pc and returned to windows 8 for such a long time.

probably around pandemic, when we were at home all the time, i wanted to dip a finger to linux ocean again somehow. tried manjaro kde, fell in love with kde with that but i got used to debian based distributions, so called "stable" distros, with time. and that was it when i dive into kde world even more. kde was my everything and believe, i was totally in love with kde in every sense. kde connect was perfect, customizations were so detailed and almost infinite, desktop was so beautiful looking and community was so huge. i realized these all with kubuntu. kde neon was kinda shit but kubuntu was "the one" for me. and it must be the distribution that i used for the longest period of my life. between 1-2 years i believe. kubuntu was epic, man!

for some reasons that era also ended at some point and i was at windows again, time passed and i also got a new thinkpad, a true linux computer, and i was ready for my third journey. at least i thought like that in that time. for my internship in 2022 i needed windows and i installed windows 10 directly after buying my new laptop and didn't face any issue to be honest. windows 11 was just a baby at that time and it wasn't looking particulary appealing. even now, it was such an unnecessary move for microsoft from my perspective. however, months passed and i windows 11 became a thing. every youtuber was making a video about and it was apparent that they kinda fixed issues coming with it and made it more usable and prettier even. yes, i would still choose windows 10 over windows 11 but microsoft did a partially well job making windows 11 look unique and "cool". after some time, microsoft declared so suddenly that they will end the support for windows 10 in 2025. there were still such a long period till 2025 at that point but this hidden forcing to push people to use windows 11 pushed me too and my windows 11 era started. until this day, i don't like it at all. i hate how it comes with so much bloatware, i hate how it uses the hardware of my computer, i hate the lack of customizations even though it's looking inherently prettier than previous windows. but there wasn't much option. at least that's what i thought.

a few weeks ago, i decided to give my old friend tux another chance. windows 11 served me okayish yet it also made me hate it from various ways. this time i tried pop!
