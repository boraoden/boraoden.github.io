i have always loved podcasts even though i have also found them overrated occasionally since it usually gives the vibes of "wow, i am learning something and doing some productive stuff". of course not all of the podcasts are "educative" but we usually associate podcasts with something productive in my humble opinion.

recently i have increased my podcast consumption and want to share a couple suggestions just in case if someone is interested. i may update these in future too. i will now only talk about the ongoing podcasts and won't include a "dead" or "finished" one. let's begin with turkish delights.

- **socrates podcasts** : some of you may know socrates from youtube. well, i wish all of their content were in spotify in a podcast format but only a few of them they bother to upload to spotify sadly. some classics like "potacast" and "socrates fc" are highly recommended to people who are into sports.

- **bu mu yani?** : i liked these guys' conversations overally when we were in pandemic but now, they sound kinda repetitive and mildly boring, they deserve a spot in worth mentioning though. they just talk about random stuff which can be beneficial for everyone.

- **aposto altı otuz** : they are just posting a short news feed podcast everyday morning. good if you are into following news but also not dive into it deeply.

- **mirgün cabas** : smart guy talking about random topics as well, also his other project involving "nereden başlasam" with can kozanoğlu is also great. he hosts guests from various areas in both of the podcasts.

- **nasıl olunur** : nilay örnek's guest hosting podcasts with 250 episodes, have some really cool episodes with nice guests.

- **haddini aşan yaşam rehberi** : internet sheriff serdar kuzuloğlu's successful podcast. he always manages to entertain the audience while talking about great topics which applies to everyday life.

- **fularsız entellik** : one must not forget the king of the podcasts. immanuel tolstoyevski is the goat of the turkish podcasts. not much need to endorse.

well these were the turkish ones. i am subscribed to some other podcasts too but this post would not end at all if i try to mention them all. let's get into english ones which will take way more place than the above.

- **anything goes with emma chamberlain** : i need to do a confession here. i was not having celebrity crushes for years but emma chamberlain changed it a bit. i don't know what but there is something that makes this girl attractive for me. her podcasts are not always my cup of tea but she is always funny. i don't follow her youtube account but podcastwise, she is great. i wish i was able to have a chat with her.

- **the joe rogan experience** : must include the goat of english podcasts as well. most of the guests are quite irrelevant for me but joe rogan is often a good one. we can discuss his views and opinions about certain stuff yet his podcast his a archival and still on-going treasure for sure.

- **the standup**, **linux unplugged** and **ogg - mintcast** : if you are into linux and tech a bit these would fit you.

- **global news podcast** : another news podcasts if you want to follow news from the perspective of british broadcasting corporation. 

- **today, explained** : vox's beautiful podcast which both talks about news and also interesting topics.

- **huberman lab** : andrew huberman talking about science, productivity, health and more usually with guests and sometimes alone. he loves to record podcasts and upload much, so if you are interested in these topics above, you would enjoy his podcast a lot!

- **lex fridman podcast** : lex fridman describes his podcast as "conversations about science, technology, history, philosophy, nature of intelligence, consciousness, love and power", which is completely true. smart and interesting guy hosting really valueable people. highly recommended but beware, almost every episode is 2-3 hours long at least.

- **modern wisdom** : another guest-hosting podcast which is also usually long but more smooth in terms of being able to listen it without getting bored compared to two podcasts above. peter crouch episode was so funny definitely worth listening.

- **art of manliness** : a great podcast about manhood and masculinity without getting toxic and misogynistic. they sometimes overpraise the old stuff and traditions and habits but overall, a great one.

- **divine intervention podcasts** : not for everyone but a really useful usmle reviews podcasts for the people who are getting ready for the mighty exam. 

- **deep questions with cal newport** : productivity author cal newport's podcasts about technology, productivity and work life balance.

- **speaking of psychology** : an unique suggestion for psychology enthusiasts. 

- **mubi podcast** : famous niche movie streaming platform's own podcast talking about movies and cinema.

- **sky sports premier league podcast** and **football weekly** : two brilliant football podcast for the beautiful sport's dear fans, especially premier league enjoyers.

- **locked on rockets** and **rockets launchpod** : specifically recommended for houston rockets and alperen şengün fans. 

ah, i got tired, i have been writing this for one hour and still could not finish all my suggestions at all. i could easily add **podsfordocs**, **in our time**, **the jordan b. peterson podcast**, **journey of ideas**, **history that doesn't suck**, **the happiness lab with dr. laurie santos**, **freakonomics radio**, **economist podcasts**, **the daily zeitgeist**, **chapo trap house** and **the chatterbox** but i don't listen these last ones as much as the ones i mentioned in the list, otherwise my whole day would be full of listening to podcasts. 

so yeah, hope you found something cool.

and dear emma chamberlain, text me sometime darling.
