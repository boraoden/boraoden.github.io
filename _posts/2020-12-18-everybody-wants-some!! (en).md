I want some too!

Actually, I even don't know how to start. Like **EWS!!** does, I might start from nowhere to finish nowhere, for the purpose of pointing out details and atmosphere of the movie and embracing them again. I know I'll look back to this review years later and I'll have a big smile on my face after watching **EWS!!** again and reading this review.

First, I agree the movie isn't much more than a classical teen movie. But what makes **EWS!!** isn't like _American Pie_ or something like that is especially **Linklater** fact. He knows very well how to satisfy his audience and I suppose who loved **Dazed and Confused**, **Boyhood** or even **Before** trilogy won't hate **Everybody Wants Some!!**. 

Let me explain more.

When I dive into his movies I usually don't think anything at all, I only imagine about the ambiance and the era of them, emotions and experiences in them. **Dazed and Confused** made me feel like a 70s teen, **EWS!!** made me feel like a 80s dude while I'm barely 20 as I am writing these. Further, in **Boyhood** I felt like I saw my entire coming of age. For me, the unique thing what makes his cinema valuable is this impact, this mastership at reflecting people's mind, their experience and their philosophy of life. 

Also I think I shouldn't get tired while watching a movie or after watching it and reading about it. I should be part of it and let myself free to the movie's flow itself. A big event or action occur rarely in <b>Linklater<b> cinema, he just makes remarkable works from simple and small people's everyday life. So this attitude makes the whole experience more important than the events in the film. Things that happen in the movie aren't too significant or memorable but movie absolutely catches you from one way and makes you part of it.

Testosterone everywhere, disco music, country bars, little punk concerts, college life and girls. To be honest, it is **EWS!!** in one sentence. But naturalness in driving scenes, Jake's phone call with Beverly, arcade game machines et cetera were certainly brilliant.

Every member of cast was amazing despite their lack of experience and they have fitted each other very well. Competition spirit among those jocks in every little thing is an important thing to mention. They are men who grew up very competitive at baseball and their personalities were shaped in that sense so we can easily observe little arguments but their fast developing friendship wasn't artificial. I haven't seen such a movie that is full of testosterone in this level till **EWS!!**.

I am repeating myself but 80s details were fascinating. From _Pink Floyd_ to _KISS_, near to die disco culture to TV series, everything, every reference were quite fine and lively.

As always, **Linklater** makes you envy the characters and their life. Like you envy the love in "**Before**"s or friendship in **Dazed and Confused**, this time you envy American style college life that is full of joy, love and friendship. From this perspective, **EWS!!** is like a mixture and final of a big process in **Linklater** cinematography because it contains a bit "**Before**"s, a bit **Boyhood** and a bit **Dazed and Confused**. 
  
Before finishing the review, I think I should say one who wants to learn **Richard Linklater** and his way of looking to life must see the **Sisyphus** scene that takes place at the lake. I wasn't expecting a scene like it but **Linklater** also hasn't surprised me. It was a beautiful dialogue for a movie like **EWS!!**. Besides **EWS!!** looks like preaching hedonistic lifestyle, that particular scene presents simple and prominent way to live a life that is full of meaning in this whole meaningless and brought a new and great viewpoint to the famous myth.

Oh, yes, lastly, that after credit! What a funny way to finish this movie and say "bye" to the audience.

Two hours without any second with regrets, two hours passed with full satisfaction!
