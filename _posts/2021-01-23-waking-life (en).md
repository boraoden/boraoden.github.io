I thought it is requisite to honor this beauty on its twentieth anniversary.

Today, _Waking Life_ has turned 20 years old and I am really happy to share the exact birth date with it.

It is the most difficult movie to review in _Linklater_ cinematography with no doubts and it is also a lovely collage about life itself. _Waking Life_ is the movie that can be a "guide for living", "a manual for the seekers of the answers of the questions 'how to live?', 'what is life and what are dreams?', 'who are we and what is our purpose in this irrational world?'"

I personally love all of the _Linklater_ works which I've watched but _Waking Life_ is a bit different from others. Although _Richard Linklater_ has made various movies after _Waking Life_, I consider it as a combination of his entire career including his post-_Waking Life_ movies. It is kind of a signature film and shouts like "Hey! This is me, _Richard Linklater_, and this is my conception of life, get used to it!"

This movie is different but, I mean, literally different. _Waking Life_ is one of the prettiest movie experiences a human being can imagine and have. One can realize and internalize a whole-new detail in it, with every little second of it.

In short, an extraordinary and beautiful composition with extraordinary script and dialogues from an extraordinary director. 
This is what _Waking Life_ is. 

Trying to explaining it further is slightly unnecessary, a must-watch example of a high quality picture.
