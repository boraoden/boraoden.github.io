it's new year's eve,

felt lazy to leave the house and go library,

fuck it, weather sucks today, 

cat purring next to me,

drank my second cup of coffee even though it's just 11 am,

aimee mann's beautiful [cover](https://youtu.be/Yf3LojyK7PA?si=dqXAr5LcOqCrEuxD) plays in background many thanks to pta,

have some beers for tonight, a bowl of popcorn maybe,

also a really chill room, 

such a cold heart,

a vague future i guess,

feeling distant to everyone, even myself,

how the months and years passed by,

i know, two can be as bad as one,

but nothing beats the one,

need to get back to life, must focus,

yet craving something special,

something i forgot,

a gesture, a simple text message perhaps,

no is the saddest experience you'll ever know,

it's just no good anymore.
