i've prepared a flashcards collection on **anki** through a full year period of third grade in mersin university faculty of medicine. this collection includes past questions of almost all exams for third grade.  

i heavily suggest you to read the _readme_ file in the link above. after i've tagged, categorized and supported the collection with some other pdfs and additional info, i thought i should open it for common use, so here it is!
